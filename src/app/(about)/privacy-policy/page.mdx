# Privacy Policy

**Last updated: 2025-10-16**

## Quick Summary

- We collect only what's necessary to run Persona and improve it.
- We never sell your data and we don't share data with advertisers.
- We don't log your private chats or personas in production. We only log usage metrics and errors.
- **Important**: Images you generate are served via public CDN links. Anyone with the link can view them—these links are hard to guess but not encrypted or access-controlled.

**Tip**: If you want an image to stay private, do not share its link. You can delete images and personas anytime.

---

## Who We Are

This Privacy Policy applies to the Persona website and services, including prsna.app (collectively, the "Services").

**Contact us**: hi@prsna.app  
**See also**: Our [Terms of Use](/terms-of-use)  
**DPA available**: A Data Processing Agreement is available upon request for business users.

---

## Our Philosophy

We believe in user freedom and creativity. Our goal is to give you powerful AI tools while protecting your privacy.

- **We never sell your data.** We don't share data with advertisers or data brokers.
- **We don't need or want to see your private content.** We design systems to collect only what's necessary.
- **When you ask for support**, we help without judgment and only look at what you explicitly authorize us to review.
- **Your freedom to create matters**—within our [Terms of Use](/terms-of-use) and applicable law.

Let's be honest: we don't care what you generate. We care that it's your data and it stays yours.

## What We Collect

### Account Data (via Clerk)

- Your Clerk user ID (stored in our database)
- Clerk manages your email, name, and authentication data
- We may receive your email via webhooks to help identify sessions in analytics
- See [Clerk's Privacy Policy](https://clerk.com/legal/privacy)

### App Content You Create

- Persona data (JSON profiles, prompts, messages, version history)
- Image generation prompts and resulting images
- Events history related to your content

### Usage and Technical Data

- IP address (for rate limiting and abuse prevention only)
- Page views, navigation events, and client-side exceptions
- Server and application logs (operational data, not content)
- Feature usage events

### Payment Data

- Subscription plan details and billing amounts
- Order/checkout IDs, transaction status, subscription IDs
- External user ID (Clerk ID) linked to your subscription
- Payment details are processed by Stripe via Clerk Billing; we do not store card numbers or bank details

---

## How We Use Your Data

We process your data to:

- **Provide the Services**: Persona creation, chat, image generation, subscription management
- **Authenticate and authorize**: Manage your account and access
- **Process payments**: Handle subscriptions and billing
- **Security and abuse prevention**: Rate limiting, fraud detection, content moderation (public content only)
- **Analytics and improvement**: Understand how features are used, fix bugs, improve performance
- **Support**: Help you troubleshoot issues (only with your explicit permission)
- **Service communications**: Send essential service updates (not marketing unless you opt in)

---

## What We DON'T Do

❌ We don't log your private chat messages or persona content in production  
❌ We don't read your chats unless you explicitly ask us to for support  
❌ We don't sell your data or share it with advertisers  
❌ We don't use your content for our own AI training

---

## Support Access (With Your Permission Only)

If you request help with a specific issue (e.g., failed image generation, billing inquiry):

- **You control access**: We only review what you explicitly identify (specific chat, image, or persona)
- **Explicit permission required**: Via email from your registered account address
- **Purpose-limited**: We use data solely to resolve your request, then stop accessing it
- **No retention**: We keep minimal support case records (ticket ID, outcome) but don't retain copies of your content

**Alternative**: If you prefer, share screenshots or direct links instead of granting access to your account data.

---

## Chat Data and Privacy

### Storage

Your conversations and messages are stored in our hosted database (Neon) so you can access your chat history across sessions.

### Access Policy

**We do not read your chats.** The only exception is when you explicitly report an issue and authorize us to review specific items to resolve your request.

### No Content Logging

We **never** log chat content or messages, even for debugging. We only log:

- Usage metadata (request counts, model ID, approximate costs)
- Errors without message content

### How Chats Are Routed

- Text generation requests go through **OpenRouter** or directly to model providers
- We **do not** attach your account ID or email to provider requests
- Any personal data in prompts is only what you choose to include
- We prioritize privacy-focused providers where available

### Free Models Disclaimer

Free models may allow providers to use prompts/outputs for training or evaluation per provider defaults. Free models may also be rate-limited or unstable.

### Your Responsibility

**Do not include sensitive personal information** (SSN, financial details, health records, etc.) in chats. You control what you share.

### Future Privacy Features

We're working on:

- End-to-end encrypted chats
- Local-only chat modes for maximum privacy

---

## AI Model Providers

### Text Generation (via OpenRouter)

- We send prompts, system instructions, and model parameters
- We do **not** attach your user ID or email
- Content includes any personal information you put in prompts
- See [OpenRouter's Privacy Policy](https://openrouter.ai/privacy)
- Model providers may process content for safety/abuse detection; some may use it for training per their defaults
- We opt out of training where providers offer that option

### Image Generation (via Runware)

- We send prompts, model selection, and generation parameters
- We do not include your user ID in requests
- See Runware's privacy policy for their data handling
