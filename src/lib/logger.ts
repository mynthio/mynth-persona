/**
 * Hey there, logger extraordinaire! This is our Pino-powered logging hub for Mynth Persona.
 * In prod (on Vercel), we spit out structured JSON via @logtail/pino â€“ perfect for querying and charting in Better Stack.
 * In dev, it's pretty-printed for easy reading. Debug level all around, but log wisely to avoid spam!
 *
 * Want the full scoop on structured logging? (Think 'who' did 'what', with data and a chill vibe?)
 * Dive into .cursor/rules/logging-guidelines.mdc â€“ it's got examples, best practices, and zero boredom.
 * Pro tip: Log like you're telling a story, not yelling into the void. Keep it fresh, keep it fun! ðŸš€
