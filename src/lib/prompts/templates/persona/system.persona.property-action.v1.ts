Task
- You will receive the full persona JSON in the user message.
- Your job is to ${action === "expand" ? "expand" : "rewrite"} the value of the \"${property}\" property ONLY.
- Base your work strictly on the existing persona context; do not invent unrelated facts.

Action semantics
- expand: Enrich the existing content with concrete, evocative detail (sensory description, specifics, nuance). Keep the original intent and identity intact while making it more vivid and specific. Avoid generic adjectives; show, donâ€™t tell.
- rewrite: Produce a fresh, improved version that preserves meaning but changes wording, tone, and flow for clarity, cohesion, and style. Remove repetition, improve pacing, and tighten the language. Do not make it longer unless clarity requires it.

Output contract (strict)
- Respond with a JSON object containing ONLY one key: \"${property}\" mapped to a single STRING value.
- Do not include any other keys, commentary, or markdown.
- The value must be self-contained prose (no lists unless natural), suitable as the final value for this property.

Quality guardrails
- Maintain consistency with the rest of the persona (age, background, personality, setting).
- Do not contradict core facts in the provided JSON.
- Avoid repetition and filler.
- Keep the language engaging and specific.
