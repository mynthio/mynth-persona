# Terms of Service for Persona

**Last updated: 2025-10-16**

## Agreement to Terms

These Terms of Service ("Terms") govern your access to and use of the Persona website and services, including prsna.app (collectively, the "Services"). By accessing or using the Services, you agree to these Terms and our [Privacy Policy](/privacy-policy).

## Eligibility and Accounts

**Age requirement**: You must be at least 18 years old or the age of majority in your jurisdiction, whichever is higher. The Services are intended for adults only, as AI-generated content may be harmful or inappropriate for minors. By using the Services, you represent that you meet this age requirement. We reserve the right to require age verification (including government-issued ID) at our discretion or where legally required.

**Compliance**: You must comply with local laws. Where local law prohibits use of the Services or requires a higher age, you may not use the Services.

**Registration**: Accounts are provided via Clerk. Provide accurate information, keep your credentials secure, and you are responsible for all activity under your account.

**Account actions**: We may suspend or terminate accounts for violations, fraud, abuse, or legal/compliance reasons. You may delete your account at any time; see our Privacy Policy for data deletion details.

## Subscriptions, Pricing, and Payments

**Payment flexibility**: We offer multiple payment options to ensure accessibility for users worldwide while maintaining compliance with payment provider requirements.

**Subscription plans**: The Services operate on a subscription basis with various tiers offering different features and usage limits. Subscriptions automatically renew at the end of each billing period (monthly or annual) unless canceled.

**Free tier**: We offer a free tier with limited features and usage. The free tier may have rate limits and restricted access to certain models or features. We may modify or discontinue the free tier at any time.

**Billing**: You will be charged at the start of each billing period. Your subscription continues until canceled. You remain responsible for all charges incurred during your subscription period.

**Cancellation**: You may cancel your subscription at any time through your account settings or billing portal. Cancellation takes effect at the end of your current billing period. You will retain access to paid features until the end of the period you've paid for.

**Refunds**:

- **Subscription refunds**: If you are dissatisfied with the Services, you may request a refund within 14 days of your initial subscription purchase. Refunds are prorated based on usage and time elapsed.
- **Cancellation**: No refunds are provided for mid-cycle cancellations, but you retain access through the end of your paid billing period.
- **Technical issues**: We may issue service credits or prorated refunds for significant technical failures or extended service outages.
- **Abuse or violations**: If your subscription is terminated for violations of these Terms, you are not entitled to a refund. However, if we terminate your subscription due to fair usage concerns (see below), we will provide a prorated refund for the unused portion of your billing period.
- **EU/UK consumer rights**: Nothing in these Terms affects your statutory rights under mandatory consumer protection laws. Contact us to discuss specific situations.

**Plan modifications**: We reserve the right to modify subscription plans, features, usage limits, and pricing at any time. Changes to pricing or material plan features will be communicated to existing subscribers with at least 30 days' notice and will take effect at your next renewal. Continued use after changes constitutes acceptance.

## Acceptable Use and Content Policy

**You may not use the Services for**:

- Content that is illegal under applicable law
- Child sexual abuse material (CSAM) or any content involving minors in sexual contexts
- Non-consensual intimate imagery or deepfakes of real individuals without consent
- Credible threats, doxxing, or incitement to violence
- Content that infringes intellectual property, trademarks, or rights of publicity/privacy
- Malware or content designed to harm systems or users

**Enforcement**: We use automated systems to detect prohibited content in publicly accessible areas and respond to user reports. Violations may result in content removal, account suspension or termination, and reporting to authorities where required by law.

**User responsibility**: AI outputs may be inaccurate, biased, or inappropriate. You are responsible for reviewing and ensuring appropriate use of all generated content. Do not rely on AI outputs for medical, legal, or financial decisions.

**Fair use**: Do not bypass technical limits, abuse the Services, or create multiple accounts to evade restrictions.

## Fair Usage Policy

**Reasonable use**: Subscription plans are designed for reasonable personal use by individual users. While we provide generous usage limits, the Services are not intended for automated access, commercial scraping, or non-human usage patterns.

**Prohibited automation**: You may not use bots, scripts, automated tools, or any other means to access the Services in an automated fashion. All usage must be through the official user interface by a human user.

**Usage patterns**: We monitor usage patterns to detect abuse. Indicators of unfair usage include but are not limited to:

- Continuous 24/7 usage that is not humanly possible
- Extremely high request volumes inconsistent with normal interactive use
- Systematic or programmatic access patterns
- Usage patterns designed to circumvent rate limits
- Sharing accounts or credentials with multiple users
- Any usage that degrades service quality for other users

**Service protection**: We invest significant resources to provide affordable subscription plans. To ensure service quality and sustainability for all users, we reserve the right to investigate unusual usage patterns and take appropriate action.

**Enforcement**: If we determine that your usage violates this Fair Usage Policy, we may:

- Temporarily rate-limit your access
- Suspend your account pending investigation
- Terminate your subscription with a prorated refund for the unused portion of your billing period
- Permanently ban your account for severe or repeated violations

**Beta status and adjustments**: The Services are currently in beta. We reserve the right to adjust usage limits, rate limits, and fair usage policies as we gather data and optimize service delivery. Material changes to limits will be communicated to subscribers with reasonable notice.

**Good faith**: This policy is not intended to restrict normal, legitimate use of the Services. If you have questions about whether your planned usage is appropriate, contact us at hi@prsna.app before proceeding.

## Content Preferences

**Default settings**: By default, the Services are configured for general audiences. You can adjust content filtering in your account settings to suit your preferences.

**Age certification**: By adjusting content preferences, you represent and warrant you are at least 18 years old or the age of majority in your jurisdiction. We may require age verification at our discretion or where legally mandated.

**Availability**: Certain content preferences may be unavailable in certain jurisdictions.

**Absolute prohibitions**: Under no circumstances may you generate or upload CSAM, sexual content involving minors, or non-consensual intimate imagery. Violations will result in immediate termination and reporting to authorities.

## Intellectual Property and Ownership

**Your content**: You retain ownership of all content you provide, including prompts, uploads, and persona data ("User Content").

**Generated content**: To the extent permitted by law and subject to third-party provider terms, we assign you all rights we may have in AI-generated outputs ("Generated Content"). However:

- Some jurisdictions may not recognize copyright in AI-generated content
- You are responsible for ensuring your use complies with applicable laws and doesn't infringe third-party rights
- Upstream model providers may impose additional restrictions per their terms

**License to us**: You grant us a worldwide, non-exclusive, royalty-free license to host, process, transmit, display, and create technical copies of your Content as necessary to operate, secure, and improve the Services.

**Training and provider processing**: We opt out of model training where providers offer that option. However, some providers may process content for safety, evaluation, or other purposes under their policies. We do not send your user ID or email to model providers in generation requests.

## Publishing Personas

**Permanent publication and licensing**: When you publish a persona, you grant us a perpetual, irrevocable, transferable, worldwide, royalty-free license to use, reproduce, modify, display, and create derivative works from that persona. This includes using the persona to generate AI content such as posts, images, videos, and interactions on the platform.

**Platform investment**: Public personas become part of our content ecosystem. We invest significant computational and financial resources to generate content for published personas. Once published, the persona operates independently and may accumulate content, interactions, and relationships within the platform.

**Separation of personal data**: This license is separate from your personal account data. You retain the right to:

- Delete your account and personal information (email, payment data, etc.)
- Request access to your personal data under GDPR and similar laws
- Update your contact information and preferences

However, the published persona and its license remain valid regardless of your account status.

**Your responsibilities**: By publishing a persona, you represent and warrant that:

- The persona complies with our Acceptable Use and Content Policy
- The persona does not infringe on any third-party intellectual property, trademark, or rights of publicity/privacy
- You have the right to grant us the license described above
- You understand that the publication and license are permanent

**Content moderation**: Published personas are subject to automated content moderation. Personas that violate our policies may be removed from public discovery, but the license grant remains in effect.

**Removal in exceptional cases**: We will consider persona removal requests only in exceptional circumstances, such as:

- Legal requirements (court orders, law enforcement requests)
- Prohibited content that violates our policies
- Identity theft or impersonation
- Other extraordinary circumstances at our sole discretion

Contact hi@prsna.app with removal requests. We evaluate each request individually and may require documentation.

**No guarantee of removal**: Due to our investment in content generation and platform integrity, we make no guarantee that removal requests will be granted, except where required by law.

## Chats (Privacy and Data)

**Storage**: Conversations and messages are stored in our hosted database (Neon). Your chats are accessible only to you within the app.

**Privacy commitment**: Our team does not read your chats. The only exception is when you explicitly report a technical issue and provide written permission for us to review specific items solely to resolve your request.

**No content logging**: We never log chat content or messages, even for debugging. We only log usage metadata (e.g., request counts, model ID, approximate costs), never your prompts or outputs.

**Content moderation limitations**: Due to our privacy-focused architecture, we do not proactively monitor private chat content. Users are responsible for ensuring their use of the Services complies with these Terms and applicable laws.

**Provider routing**: Text generations are routed via OpenRouter and other providers. We prioritize privacy-focused providers where available. We do not include your account identifiers in requests to providers; they do not receive your user identity from us.

**Model availability**: Models may be rate-limited, unstable, or unavailable without notice. Different subscription tiers provide access to different models and rate limits.

**Provider transparency**: We identify certain models by their provider (e.g., Venice) so you can review their privacy policies. We plan to add labels indicating data usage and privacy characteristics as information becomes available.

**Your responsibility**: Do not share sensitive personal information in chats. You are responsible for what you choose to input.

**Future roadmap**: We are working on end-to-end encrypted chats and local-only modes to further enhance privacy.

## Third-Party Services

The Services integrate third parties including Clerk (auth), payment processors and cryptocurrency providers (payments), OpenRouter and upstream model vendors (text models), Runware (image generation), Bunny.net (storage/CDN), Neon (database), Vercel (hosting), Trigger.dev (background jobs), PostHog and LogSnag (analytics), and Better Stack/Logtail (logs). Your use of certain features may be subject to those providers' terms and policies. Providers and models may change, be rate-limited, or deprecated without notice.

## Your Data Rights

**Access and control**: You can access, update, and delete your account data through the app settings at any time.

**Data protection**: Users in certain jurisdictions (including the EU, UK, and California) have additional rights including data portability, objection to processing, and withdrawal of consent. Contact hi@prsna.app to exercise these rights.

**Data retention**:

- Account data: Retained until you request deletion, plus a brief period for backups
- Chat data: Retained until you delete them, plus backup retention period
- Usage logs: Retained for a limited time for security and fraud prevention

See our [Privacy Policy](/privacy-policy) for complete details.

## Disclaimers and Limitations

**"As is" service**: The Services are provided "as is" and "as available" without warranties of any kind, express or implied, including merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, and non-infringement. AI outputs may be inaccurate, incomplete, or harmful.

**No SLA**: We do not guarantee uptime or availability. Models, features, and providers may change or become unavailable at any time.

**Limitation of liability**: To the maximum extent permitted by law, our aggregate liability for any claims related to the Services is limited to the amount you paid us in the 12 months before the claim. We are not liable for indirect, incidental, special, consequential, or punitive damages.

**Indemnification**: You agree to defend and indemnify us against claims arising from your Content or your misuse of the Services in violation of these Terms, applicable laws, or third-party rights, except to the extent caused by our own negligence or misconduct.

## Changes and Updates

**Service changes**: We may add, change, or remove features, models, providers, usage limits, rate limits, or pricing at any time. Given that the Services are currently in beta, you should expect changes as we refine the platform based on usage data, technical capabilities, and business requirements.

**Beta features**: Beta or experimental features (clearly labeled as such) are provided "as is" without support and may be changed or discontinued without notice.

**Usage limits**: We may adjust subscription plan limits, rate limits, and feature availability as we optimize service delivery. For existing subscribers, material reductions to plan benefits will be communicated with reasonable notice and will typically take effect at your next renewal.

**Terms updates**: We may update these Terms from time to time. Material changes will be communicated via email or in-app notice at least 30 days before taking effect. Continued use after changes constitutes acceptance.

## Governing Law

These Terms are governed by the laws of Poland, without regard to conflict of laws principles. Disputes will be resolved in the courts of Warsaw, Poland, except where mandatory local consumer protection laws require otherwise.

## General

**Entire agreement**: These Terms and our Privacy Policy constitute the entire agreement between you and Persona regarding the Services.

**Severability**: If any provision is found invalid or unenforceable, the remaining provisions remain in effect.

**Assignment**: We may assign these Terms (e.g., in connection with a sale or merger). You may not assign your rights without our consent.

**Contact**: For questions or to exercise your rights, contact us at hi@prsna.app.
